This Project Takes tweets from a few sources and pairs them with images from the getty images api.

The images are gathered from a few twitter accounts through their user id. From those accounts I pull quotes from 
Donald trump and quotes from past presidents to compare them and show how different the age we live in is.

Improvements could be made by making the tweet pulls more dynamic by making the search based on keywords and hashtags and parsing through those statuses
for a more dynamic feel. Along with improving the HTML and CSS for a prettier format.

Known Problems: I was getting errors using the Config VArs as it would read parts of my json dump calls as a key, yet they were not
I tried many things, but I would have to change the way I get URLS for my images. 

Overall I came away learning a lot and really enjoyed the project.
