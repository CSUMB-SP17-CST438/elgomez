#This webapp Is used to pull and compare tweets with quotes of past Uinted states leaders and compare them to trump. The difference between these two things is very amusing

Searches for twitter api is pulling from a few users. And then randomly chooses a tweet from their timeline. These searches are pulling quotes from past United states presidents and a couple sources for our current president.

Known Problems: Wrapping of text on the front end is a bit off, as well as the centering of the image. The CSS took me the most time, because I had to pull from many tutorials and could be better.

I could improve on the HTML and CSS as well as making more dynamic tweet choices by pulling from more users or using many keywords and parsing tweets for quotations and attributions within the status.
